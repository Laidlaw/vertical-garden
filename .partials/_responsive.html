        <p>As you may have noticed, DoCSSa makes a quite heavy use of Sass placeholders. This is nice until
        you try to use them from within a media query, and stumble onto the dreaded <em>"You may not @extend
        an outer selector from within @media. You may only @extend selectors within the same directive."</em>
        error message. <br>
            But fear not, my friend! Until this gets fixed in Sass, there are ways around it.</p>
        <p>In order to be able to use your components in any context, you'll only have a few things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All <strong>breakpoints need to be named and predefined</strong> in the <strong>$breakpoints variable</strong> located in
                base/_config.scss
            </li>
            <li><strong>Placeholders definition</strong> need to be done through the provided <strong>_add()</strong> mixin</li>
            <li><strong>Placholders use</strong> need to be done through the provided <strong>_use()</strong> mixin</li>
            <li><strong>@media blocks</strong> need to be called through the provided <strong>breakpoint()</strong> mixin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you respect this process, which is a bargain, you can enjoy helpers and components anywhere
            in your sass structure. Aren't you just glad you came ?</p>

        <div class="exampleNote">
            <p>Here is how we implemented our "clearfix" helper for a responsive environment :</p>

            <samp class="sampleTitle">// in utils/_helpers.scss</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
@include _add(clearfix) {
&amp;:before,
&amp;:after {
content: " ";
display: table;
}
&amp;:after {
clear: both;
}
*zoom: 1;
}
</pre>
            <p>As you can see, we just replaced the traditional <em>%clearfix</em> definition with
                <em>@include _add(clearfix)</em>.</p>
            <p class="note">If you've already defined placeholders in DoCSSa before,
                a simple regex can do the conversion for you : replace <em>%([^ {]+)\s*\{</em>
                with <em>@include _add($1) {</em> and you're done!
                </p>
            <p>When creating the <em>_add()</em> mixin, we made sure it wouldn't break compatibility.
            That means that our clearfix placeholder can still be used with a simple <em>@extend %clearfix</em>
                as long as you're not within a media query block. But now, it can do much more!</p>
            <p>First, you need to define the breakpoints :</p>
            <samp class="sampleTitle">// in base/_config.scss</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
$breakpoints: (
"small": 600px,
"medium": 900px,
"large": 1200px
);
</pre>
            <p>Once this is done, you can call the "clearfix" placeholder from within a media query with the
            following syntax:</p>
            <samp class="sampleTitle">// crossmedia placeholders example</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
.a {
@include _use(clearfix);
}

.b {
@extend %clearfix;
}

.c {
@include breakpoint(medium) {
@include _use(clearfix);
}
}

@include breakpoint(medium) {
.d {
@include _use(clearfix);
}
}

.e {
@include _use(clearfix);

@include breakpoint(large) {
@include _use(clearfix);
}
}
</pre>
            <p>Here is what the end result would look like in your custom.css file :</p>
<pre class="codeSample">
@media (min-width: 900px) {
.c,
.d {
*zoom: 1;
}
.c:before,
.d:before,
.c:after,
.d:after {
content: " ";
display: table;
}
.c:after,
.d:after {
clear: both;
}
}
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
.e {
*zoom: 1;
}
.e:before,
.e:after {
content: " ";
display: table;
}
.e:after {
clear: both;
}
}
.a,
.b,
.e {
*zoom: 1;
}
.a:before,
.b:before,
.e:before,
.a:after,
.b:after,
.e:after {
content: " ";
display: table;
}
.a:after,
.b:after,
.e:after {
clear: both;
}
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>As you can see, everything ends up nicely in the correct media query, as if you had wrote it
        down manually. There is a little difference with the old school, hands in the dirt approach though:
        you can now have your logic in a single place, and stay DRY all the way!</p>
