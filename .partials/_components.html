        <p>Components are an important part of DoCSSa. They are intended to be as reusable and
            extendable as possible. Ideally, they should be reusable in a totally different project without
            writing any additionnal code. They are, along with the placeholder helpers, the "Deferred Object" part of DoCCSa,
            thanks to the power of
            placeholders and mixins.
        </p>
        <p>We say the Object is Deferred because its core resides in an abstraction (the placeholders)
            instead of being tied to a classname. DoCSSa's components are class agnostic. They are made of placeholders
            and mixins. The placeholders
            define a component, and a component mixin is in charge of binding those placeholders to one
            or several HTML class(es). Thanks to the BEM naming convention, the class passed to the component mixin can be
            a prefix for other classes onto which to bind placeholder functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>This allows for components to be instantiated on any class, and to be extendable if needed.
        </p>
        <p>As the component is not tied to a particular class, you can use it on whatever class you want, whenever you want,
            from the CSS side. That means that you can (and should) keep a semantic meaning to your HTML classes, and change
            their look and feel without having to modify the markup. When your markup comes from a RTE, this is a huge gain.
            You can change the styling without asking the contributors to change their habits, and you can
            affect everything already written without having to make search&amp;replace throughout a database or without
            having a "red" class helper mean the color is going to be purple!
        </p>
        <p class="exampleNote">
            For example, instead of having a link with the "button red"
            classes, you can give it a "navTrigger" class and bind a button component with a red skin to it. You could
            also use the same component on a "submitTrigger" class so that both look the same. When time comes
            to have a different look for your submits, all you have to do is bind the submitTrigger to another component
            and you're done, without affecting the navTriggers and without touching the markup.
        </p>
        <p>If you need a component
            with a slightly different behaviour than the original one, you have two options : you can pass a parameter to
            the mixin to change the binding (or rules), or you can create a subComponent that will import the component's
            definition to get access to its placeholders, and make a new mixin that will handle the altered implementation.
        </p>
        <div class="exampleNote">
            <p>For example, your component can bind the %exampleAltState placeholder to #{$selector}:hover by default,
                but bind it to the #{$selector}_#{$hover} class for special cases.<br>
                Here is what it could look like :
            </p>

            <samp class="sampleTitle">// component example</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
// map the placeholders content to some selectors through a mixin
@mixin example($selector: '.example', $hover: ':hover', $param2: '', $defaultSkin: true) {

#{$selector} {
@extend %example;
}

#{$selector}_inner {
@extend %exampleInner;
}

@if $hover == ':hover' {
#{$selector}:hover {
@extend %exampleAltState;
}
} @else {
#{$selector}_#{$hover} {
@extend %exampleAltState;
}
}

@if $defaultSkin != false {
@include example-skin-default($selector, $hover, $param2);
}

}
</pre>

        </div>
        <p>In order to fulfill their role, components need to respect those two guidelines :</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>A component should be <strong>self contained</strong>.</p>

                <p class="note">This means that what is outside of the visual boundaries of the
                    component doesn't belong in the component definition. Typically, things like margins or positioning
                    should reside in the "specifics" folder, not in the component. This is required for your component to
                    live in any possible context.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Structure(layout) should be dissociated from skin(paint)</strong>.</p>

                <p class="note">For example, background color, images, text colors, etc. should go into the skin section of the
                    component,
                    not in its core definition. That way, you can create additional styles for them without
                    altering their expected behaviour as a component, and choose what visual style you want when binding
                    the component to a classname.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, it's up to you to compose with those precepts and adapt them to your constraints, but
            respecting them results in a clean separation of concerns and genuinely reusable components, which is much
            likely to make your dev faster further down the road, and that
            is what DoCSSa is aiming for.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            When beginning with DoCSSa, it's easy to think as everything as components, as they are so powerful.
            You must be careful about that, and think about what needs to be a component and what doesn't.<br>
            If you component-ize every set of rules, you risk spending more time building the same thing as you
            would have in the "specifics" folder without enough additional value for it to be worth it.
            Try to begin with small components to get the hang of it, and adjust your use little by little.<br>
            You can begin everything the way you are used to in the "specifics" folder, organize it
            in imported files and subfolders the DoCSSa way, and only extract a functionality to a component
            when you feel that it would help you.<br>
            DoCSSa only gives you tools to play with, what you implement and how you do things with it is up to you.
            That's what we believe a "framework" should be anyway.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">Description</h2>
        <p>When looking at a component folder, you may see three files, and eventually some subfolders.
            Let's take a <em>Tabs</em> component as an example, as probably everyone has already seen a tabbed
            navigation in a page. The files in the Tabs folder would be: <em>_tabs.scss</em>, <em>tabs.standalone.scss</em>,
            and <em>tabs.standalone.html</em>.
        </p>
        <p>The underscore prefixed file (_tabs.scss) is the component definition. It is the only essential file for the
            component, the others are optional.<br>
            Let's look at it in details.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mainSection_smallTitle" id="components_definition">Component's definition</h3>
        <p>The component definition file contains two sets of placeholders
            named after the component's name, and two mixins. One set is for the component structure, one for
            the component's skin. Placeholders are wrapped in a <em>define</em> mixin, so that we can import the
            component from anywhere without any risk of having our placeholders duplicated in the final css.
        </p>
        <p>Here's the <em>structure</em> part of our "tabs" component :</p>

        <div class="sample">
            <ul class="sampleHeader">
                <li class="sampleHeader_item _is_current">
                    <span class="sampleHeader_link">// components/tabs/_tabs.scss</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
<pre class="codeSample">
@import 'sass/base/utils/__utils';

// _____ STRUCTURE _____ //

// define component placeholders for component contents (no selector here except for component's id)
@include define('tabs') {

%tabs {
list-style: none;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
font-size: 0;
display: inline-block;
}

%tabs_item{
@include remIt(font-size, 18);
padding: 10px 0;
display: inline-block;
vertical-align: bottom;
}

%tabs_link {
padding: 0 10px;
}

}


// map the placeholders content to some selectors through a mixin
@mixin tabs($selector, $defaultSkin: true) {

#{$selector} {
@extend %tabs;
}

#{$selector}_item {
@extend %tabs_item;
}

#{$selector}_link {
@extend %tabs_link;
}



@if $defaultSkin != false {
@include tabs-skin-default($selector);
}

}
</pre>


        <p>Don't worry about the id selector for now, we'll get back to it in the "standalone component" chapter.</p>
        <p>First, the component imports 'sass/base/utils/__utils', which will give it access to the default
            mixins and helpers. Thanks to the <em>define</em> mixin, all components can safely import this folder.
        </p>
        <p>Then, a bunch of placeholders are defined, wrapped in a <em>define</em> mixin so that they can safely be imported
            by subComponents if needed. They are the core of the component, and define what needs to be implemented
            on the various classes or states of the component.<p>
        <p>Below the defined wrapped placeholders is a mixin named after the component. Its role is to
            actually bind the components placeholders to the provided classname, its "elements", and its state.
        </p>
        <p>By default, the component binding will also implement the default skin. If we have defined another
            skin, all we need to do is pass "$defaultSkin: false" when instantiating the component, and
            call another skin binding mixin to handle the component's skin.
        </p>
        <p class="note">We said earlier that a component folder may have subfolders. One of those is a "_skins"
            folder that would host different skins that we could import as needed. The other possible folders
            are subComponents folders, that would extend the component. The "_skins" folder is prefixed by an underscore only
            so that it always show on top of the list, instead of appearing among the subComponents folders.
        </p>
        <p>Now let's look at the <em>skin</em> part of our "tabs" component :
        </p>
        <samp class="sampleTitle">// A component's skin part</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
// _____ SKIN _____ //
@import 'sass/base/project/_variables';
@import 'sass/base/project/_helpers';


// define component placeholders for component skin (no selector here)
@include define('tabs-skin-default') {

%tabs-skin-default__item {
border-bottom: solid 3px transparent;
}

%tabs-skin-default__item_current {
border-bottom: solid 3px $color-green;
}

%tabs-skin-default__item_hover {
border-bottom: solid 3px $color-green-light;
}


%tabs-skin-default__link {
border-left: solid 1px $color-green;
text-decoration: none;
color: $color-green;
}

%tabs-skin-default__link_first {
border-left: inherit;
}

%tabs-skin-default__item_hover_link {
color: $color-green-light;
}

%tabs-skin-default__item_current_link {
color: $color-green-light;
}

%tabs-skin-default__item_highlighted {
color: $color-grey-dark;
}

}

// provide a default skin for the component
// only visual changes that don't affect the component layout should be in here
@mixin tabs-skin-default($selector) {

#{$selector}_item {

@extend %tabs-skin-default__item;

&amp;._is_current {
@extend %tabs-skin-default__item_current;
}

&amp;:hover {
@extend %tabs-skin-default__item_hover;
}


}

#{$selector}_link {

@extend %tabs-skin-default__link;

#{$selector}_item:first-child &amp; {
@extend %tabs-skin-default__link_first;
}

&amp;:hover {
@extend %tabs-skin-default__item_hover_link;
}

#{$selector}_item#{'--highlighted'} &amp; {
@extend %tabs-skin-default__item_highlighted;
}

#{$selector}_item._is_current &amp; {
@extend %tabs-skin-default__item_current_link;
}
}

}
</pre>

        <p>As you can see, it is very close to the structure part. Actually it is placed inside the component's
            folder for simplicity, but it could very well reside in a _skins folder right away.
        </p>
        <p>As the "skin" part of the component is usually project related, it makes sense that it imports
            the _variables and _helpers files. This is only a requirement when generating standalone CSS, as those
            files would be already imported from the custom.scss file in the context of your project.
        </p>
        <p class="note">We recommend that the "structure" part of the component doesn't make use of any
            project variable in order to stay as generic and reusable as possible.<br>
            Usually that is not a problem, but if for some reason you need to import the project variables anyhow for you
            component structure,
            you're just one @import away.
        </p>
        <p class="note">As stated before, a component's "structure" should only contain it's layout, it's skeleton.
            The "skin" part, unlike the structure, should
            <em>only
                contain</em> rules that <em>don't affect</em> the structure. These rules can be
            background-colors,
            background-images, border-radius, shadows, opacity... Anything you want as long as it doesn't
            fiddle with the component's external boundaries.<br>
            It is not always easy, but the more you practice it
            the
            more it feels natural, and the easier it is to find out the right place when you come back to adjust
            something about your component.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mainSection_smallTitle" id="components_implementation">Implementation</h3>
        <p>Now that we know how a component is structured, it's time to implement it.
            This is done by calling the component mixin and passing it a class selector.
        </p>
        <p>Here's what an implementation may look like :</p>
        <samp class="sampleTitle">// in specifics/_main.scss</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
@include tabs('.mainMenu');
</pre>
        <p>That's right, now that you have defined your component, using it is as easy as that!</p>
        <p>And here is what the output css will look like :</p>




        <samp class="sampleTitle">// in css/custom.css</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
.mainMenu {
list-style: none;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
font-size: 0;
display: inline-block;
}

.mainMenu_item {
font-size: 18px;
padding: 10px 0;
display: inline-block;
vertical-align: bottom;
}
.cssremunit .mainMenu_item {
font-size: 1.125rem;
}

.mainMenu_link {
padding: 0 10px;
}


.mainMenu_item {
border-bottom: solid 3px transparent;
}

.mainMenu_item._is_current {
border-bottom: solid 3px #449888;
}

.mainMenu_item:hover {
border-bottom: solid 3px #5cbcaa;
}

.mainMenu_link {
border-left: solid 1px #449888;
text-decoration: none;
color: #449888;
}

.mainMenu_item:first-child .mainMenu_link {
border-left: inherit;
}

.mainMenu_link:hover {
color: #5cbcaa;
}

.mainMenu_item._is_current .mainMenu_link {
color: #5cbcaa;
}

.mainMenu_item--highlighted .mainMenu_link {
color: #333333;
}
</pre>
        <p>If later on you need to bind the tabs component to another class, all you have to do is to call the mixin
            with that class and the parameters you want, and you're done!
        </p>
        <p>For example :</p>
        <samp class="sampleTitle">// in specifics/_main.scss</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
@include tabs('.articleTabs', $defaultSkin: false);
@include tabs-skin-alternate('.articleTabs');
</pre>
        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle" id="components_standalone">Standalone component</h2>
        <p>The _tabs.scss file is really the only one needed for your component, as long as it includes a skin
            for the component. But there are two other files that we presented earlier : <em>tabs.standalone.scss</em>
            and <em>tabs.standalone.html</em>.<br>
            Those are here to provide a version of the component already bound to a classname, and
            an html template describing what the associated markup should look like.<br>
            As the tabs.standalone.scss file isn't prefixed with an underscore, it will get rendered by Sass into a .css file.
            This can be useful when you want some javascript to dynamically instantiate a component and load
            its associated CSS, instead of providing the component's CSS along with the main stylesheet.
        </p>
        <div class="exampleNote">
            <p>Here's what the standalone scss file would look like for our tabs example :</p>
            <samp class="sampleTitle">// tabs.standalone.scss</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
@import '_tabs.scss';

#docssaComponent__tabs-dynamicTabs {
content: 'loaded';
}

@include tabs('.dynamicTabs');
</pre>

            <p>As you can see, we use an id in the standalone version of the component. It is intended
                for load detection : <br>when dynamically loading components from javaScript, you should
                first
                check if it hasn't already been loaded from some other place, and only load it if
                required.<br>
                We recommend using the component name, separated by a dash from the classname it is
                bound to,
                and prefixed by <em>#docssaComponent</em>. <br>
                This way you'll know what you're dealing with,
                and avoid collision with other CSS selectors.</p>
        </div>


        <p>Each component folder should also contain a standalone version and a HTML example, so
            that fellow developers
            know what is the expected structure HTML-wise and can test the result easily.<br>
            Components need a structure to apply on. If they didn't, a placeholder helper would be
            enough.<br>
            It can be really useful to maintain a project Style Guide, including every component
            standalone as a reference.
        </p>

        <div class="exampleNote">
            <p>Here's what the html sample file may look like for our tabs example :</p>
