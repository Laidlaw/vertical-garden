        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">Basics</h2>

        <p>In DoCSSa, the file system is divided in four main directories in the sass folder :</p>

        <ul class="firstOrderList">
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_base">base</a>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_components">components</a>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_specifics">specifics</a>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_vendor">vendor</a>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each base folder has a specific role, and CSS rules for a particular set of elements will end up in one of
            these directories, according to their nature.<br>
            The structure has a single point of entry, which we'll call <em>custom.scss</em>.
            This file is located at the root of the sass folder.</p>

        <p class="note">In most cases, it will be the only file with no
            underscore(_) prefix : as you may know, the .scss to .css convertion process in Sass only converts
            files that don't have an underscore in front of them. Most of the files in our structure being imported
            by other files, they don't need to be rendered directly.<br>
            Only components may be rendered separately, in order to be able to dynamically load them if needed,
            but we'll get back to it.
        </p>

        <p>The main .scss file will look something like this :</p>

        <div class="sample">
            <ul class="sampleHeader">
                <li class="sampleHeader_item _is_current">
                    <span class="sampleHeader_link">// custom.scss</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

<pre class="codeSample">
@charset "UTF-8";

/*!
========== INIT
*/
@import 'vendor/_normalize';


/*!
========== BASE
*/
// variables, fonts, mixins, helpers... common styles used across the entire site
@import 'base/__base';


/*!

/*!
========== SPECIFICS
*/
// declarations specific to the project, organized according to the items/sections represented
@import 'specifics/__specifics';
</pre>
        </div>

            <p>As you can see, it mostly acts as an aggregator for other files, which themselves import some
                other scss files, and so on. With a well thought organization, this construct can prove very powerful.</p>

            <p class="note">On a sidenote, remember that Sass is only a CSS precompiler, so you'll end up with only one .css file
                with all the goodies, not a bunch of HTTP requests!</p>

            <p>Here is an overview of what a basic file system might look like :</p>

        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle" id="fileStructure_base">Base folder</h2>

        <p>The "base" folder contains rules that are global to the site. It is divided in two parts : </p>
        <ul class="firstOrderList">
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_base_utils">utils</a>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_base_project">project</a>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">Both summary files (__project.scss and __utils.scss) for those folders import the <em>base/_config.scss</em> file which contains
            configuration information required by both the system and the project. If you're wondering why we don't
            import the config from the __base.scss file, you're asking yourself the right questions! We had to
            stray a bit from our convention about sass files organization on that one in order to ease the standalone components generation.
            We assumed it was better to import the file twice in "base" than once in "base" and then once for each
            component declaration.<br>
            As of today, this file contains $baseFontSize which is required for the
            "remIt" mixin, and $breakpoints which is required for cross-media placeholders.</p>
        <p>
            <strong id="fileStructure_base_utils">Utils</strong> contains only things that don't need to change
            from a project to another. As of today,
            it consists of <em>_system</em>, <em>_helpers</em>, and <em>_mixins</em>.
        </p>
        <ul class="secondaryList">
            <li class="secondaryList_item">
                <div class="secondaryList_item_content">
                    <p><em>_system</em> is a special file the contains tools used by DoCSSa.<br>
                        Most notably, it contains a <em>define</em> mixin used to allow inclusion of placeholders
                        from several places without generating duplicate content, and <em>_add()/_use()</em> mixins for
                      handling cross media placeholders.
                    </p>

                    <p class="note">To have a
                        specific
                        component's CSS file rendered, the component's .scss file needs to import the placeholders
                        contained in <em>_helpers.scss</em>.
                        But when
                        generating the whole project's CSS, we don't want that multiple import to screw up the
                        output.
                        <em>define</em> is a simple mixin taking advantage of the <em>@content</em> instruction Sass
                        provides, which
                        allows us in the end to have a clean .css file even though we import our placeholders file several
                        times
                        from various places. Dig in the provided example structure if you want to find out how
                        this works.
                    </p>

                    <p class="note">As you'll notice, DoCSSa makes heavy use of placeholders. By default, Sass
                        doesn't like it when you try to use a placeholder defined on the root from within a
                        media query and will throw nasty errors at you for that. Thankfully, some nice folks have
                        found a way around it, and we've implemented it in DoCSSa. More on that in the "Responsive"
                        section.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="secondaryList_item">
                <div class="secondaryList_item_content">
                    <p><strong>_helpers</strong> are Sass placeholders that represent a simple
                        CSS functionnality that can be implemented by many classes. For example, %clearfix can be extended
                        by any class that would need to contain floats.
                    </p>

                    <p class="note">Placeholders have been a great addition to Sass. They are the magic that allows us to have
                        an
                        object
                        oriented
                        architecture without polluting the markup. For those not familiar with placeholders,
                        they work a
                        bit like mixins, but instead of placing a set of CSS rules within the selector
                        implementing
                        them, they add that selector to the list of selectors on which to apply a set of CSS rules.<br>
                        This may not seem as much, but you'll see some of the awesome stuff we can do with
                        it in the
                        components section.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="secondaryList_item">
                <div class="secondaryList_item_content">
                    <p><strong>_mixins</strong> have quite the same purpose as placeholders,
                        but they do require parameters.
                        Mixins are
                        particularily useful for handling vendor prefixes and fallbacks. For example, DoCSSa comes with
                        a
                        linear-gradient mixin that compiles to all required vendor prefixes (and only those required!)
                        and generates a
                        fallback color from the input values for browsers that don't support linear-gradient at all.
                        DoCSSa
                        recommends using Modernizr for feature detection and progressive enhancement, and the provided
                        mixins
                        implementing CSS3 features rely on it by default for their output, even though it can be
                        disabled at include time.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p class="note">Mixins, like placeholders, can accumulate and enrich your library
                        with no cost, as they are only compiled when used.<br>
                        Mixins are a great way to avoid repetition when coding, but they end up in code
                        repetition
                        in the css output. That's why we only use them when they have to output something that
                        needs to be configured.
                        For generic code that can be reused as-is, we use placeholder helpers instead.</p>

                    <aside class="exampleNote">
                        <p>Here's what a mixin may look like in the <em>utils/_mixins</em> file :</p>

                        <samp class="sampleTitle">// base/utils/_mixins.scss</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
@mixin linear-gradient($from, $to, $fallback: '', $useModernizr: true) {

$prefixes: getPrefixes(cssgradients, $useModernizr);

#{map-get($prefixes, no)} &amp; {
@if $fallback != '' {
background-color: $fallback;
} @else {
background-color: mix($from, $to);
}
}

#{map-get($prefixes, yes)} &amp; {
background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from($from), to($to)); // Saf4+, Chrome

background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, $from, $to);
}

}
</pre>

                            <p>And an example of placeholder in the <em>utils/_helpers</em> file :</p>

                        <p class="note">
                            Note that we use <em>@include _add(clearfix)</em> here instead of <em>%clearfix</em>. This

                        In our implementation, we use a font mixin that is in charge of generating a bulletproof syntax
                        according to the passed configuration for each needed font, according to a file naming convention.</p>

                    <p class="note"> But where do we have to place the font files themselves, you may be wondering? Well, as
                        this Sass structure is
                        intended to be compiled to CSS in a different directory, the fonts will be in that directory.
                        Typically, you'll have the <em>custom.scss</em> file in a "sass" folder" compiled to a
                        <em>custom.css</em> in a
                        "css" or "styles" folder. The font files will have to be there (preferably in a "fonts"
                        subfolder in order to stay nice and tidy).<br>
                        Same goes for all the image files you may be referring to in your stylesheets.

                        headings and link defaults, etc. are defined here. It is also be a good place to store
                        your layout definition if it is used for all pages on the site.

                        and can be applied to your selector through a simple @extend, this is where it belongs.
                        For more advanced reusable components, the "components" section is what you're looking for.

        <p>
            The "components" folder is where your complex ui-components are located. It plays quite the same
            role as the <em>_helpers</em> file in the base/project folder, but in a way more evolved way. You can
            think of it as configurable helpers on steroids.<br>
            Components are so important in DoCSSa that we needed a dedicated section to explain all there is to know about them,

        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle" id="fileStructure_specifics">Specifics folder</h2>

        <p>The "specifics" folder is your common playground. It is where you'll place the rules that don't belong
            in the "base" or "components" folders. Until you become fluent with DoCSSa's organization rules, what will
            eventually
            end up in a component will probably exist in here first.</p>

        <p>Specifics is the closest thing to your usual CSS file, except for it's organization. Everything in there
            is split and dispatched in files and folders according to what they apply to.</p>

        <p>By convention, we're using two underscores(__) as a prefix for files that act (mostly) as an import
            summary,
            and only one underscore(_) for files which are content only. This usually evolves with the
            project: you
            begin with an underscore prefixed file, you add another one, and at some point you stop calling them
            directly from the main .scss file and you reorganize them in a folder with a summary file. </p>
        <aside class="exampleNote">
            <p>For example you might begin writing some rules in specifics/__specifics.scss, and as it grows
                realize that
                you have a bunch of rules all related to the popin windows. You'd then move those rules in a
                _popin.scss
                file and import that file from __specifics.scss.</p>

            <p>
                After a while, you'll notice that you added
                some rules for a
                bunch of specific popins on your site. That would be a good time to create a "popins" folder and
                split
                the specific popin rules to different files in that folder (say, popins/_popin-loginForm.scss
                and
                popins/_popin-congratulations.scss).<br>
                Instead of importing _popins.scss from __specifics.scss, you'd then import popins/__popins.scss
                instead,
                and let this summary file import all the specific popins required for your project.</p>

            <p>This allow you to have all your feature related files in the same folder, and one summary
                specific to that kind
                of feature which can import or leave out the files in its section as easily as commenting out a
                line. If
                at some point you realize that you don't want to use the congratulations popin anymore, all you
                have to do
                is to comment out the line importing its definition file (_popin-congratulations.scss) from the
                popins summary
                (popins/__popins.scss).</p>
        </aside>

        <p class="note">DoCSSa encourages you to keep your definitions tidy and reorganize in subfolders as soon as it makes
            sense.<br>
            No file should ever be big enough that you can't scroll through it in a few mousewheel movements
            max.</p>

        <p>Before everyone in your team is familiar with DoCSSa, it can be helpful for occasional contributors
            wondering where to place their code to have a dedicated file. In such case, we recommend using
            a <em>_inbox.scss</em> file in the "specifics" folder and ask them to commit their work in there.<br>
            It shall be emptied regularly by a more experienced DoCSSa user, who would move the CSS rules
            defined in there to the correct place in the architecture.

        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle" id="fileStructure_vendor">Vendor folder</h2>

        <p>The <em>vendor</em> folder is where we place CSS files that come from third parties and can be updated at
            any time. As the .scss syntax is CSS compatible, all we have to do is to rename the .css file to
            .scss, in order for it to be integrated to the .css compilation instead of referenced by the CSS
            file as a classic @import.</p>

        <p class="note"><em>_normalize.scss</em> is an excellent candidate for this section, along with more project specific
            third
            party CSS.</p>
