        <p>In DoCSSa, we decided to follow BEM class naming convention.<br>
            HTML class names for <em>Blocks</em> are lowerCamelCase, and the <em>Elements</em> nested
            within are separated by
            an underscore(_). <em>Modifiers</em> are separated by a double dash(--), and they are used
            for elements
            <em>variants</em>. An element's <em>state</em> is written separately with a pattern that
            begins with "_is_".
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            <em>Variants</em> are dissociated from <em>states</em> because they play a different role,
            and it appeared
            that with our components architecture, having a simple "_is_current" class for our items'
            "current" state was
            way more
            effective than a "mainMenu_item--current" when it came to modifying the state through
            javascript.<br>
            BEM modifiers are now exclusively used for visual variants that don't change over time. For
            example,
            if a tab needs to be highlighted so that it stand out, it is applied a variant.<br>
            By opposition, a "state" is something that is supposed to be handled by javascript and
            change over time.
        </p>

        <div class="exampleNote">
            <p>Here is an example of what that convention may look like in our tab example :</p>
            <samp class="sampleTitle">// naming example</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
&lt;nav class="mainNav"&gt;
&lt;ul class="mainMenu"&gt;
&lt;li class="mainMenu_item"&gt;
&lt;a class="mainMenu_link" href="#"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="mainMenu_item"&gt;
&lt;a class="mainMenu_link" href="#about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="mainMenu_item"&gt;
&lt;a class="mainMenu_link" href="#fileStructure"&gt;File Structure&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="mainMenu_item"&gt;
&lt;a class="mainMenu_link" href="#components"&gt;Components&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="mainMenu_item _is_current"&gt;
&lt;a class="mainMenu_link" href="#namingConventions"&gt;Naming conventions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="mainMenu_item"&gt;
&lt;a class="mainMenu_link" href="#responsive"&gt;Responsive&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="mainMenu_item"&gt;
&lt;a class="mainMenu_link" href="#gettingStarted"&gt;Getting started&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="mainMenu_item mainMenu_item--highlighted"&gt;
&lt;a class="mainMenu_link" href="#contributing"&gt;Contributing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav>
</pre>
            Note that this example is taken from the menu you're looking at just now in the present
            page.
        </div>
        <p>At first, the BEM notation style can seem quite verbose and put off some developers, but it
            is very
            powerful and allows us to go way behind old school naming conventions.<br>
            It has to be tamed, though, and a classic beginner's mistake is to reflect the position of
            each
            element in the component's DOM in its class name. To avoid that, we recommend that you look
            at your
            low level elements first (those deeper in the DOM tree) and wonder if they could exist
            elsewhere in the page
            or in the component.
            Going up the tree, you can identify your most basic reusable components and set the names
            accordingly.
        </p>

        <p class="exampleNote">
            For example, in our example above, the "mainMenu_link" class doesn't need to reflect the
            fact that it
            is contained in a "mainMenu_item", this doesn't really matter to the link, so there is no
            reason to
            specify it in its name.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">Sass files</h2>

        <p>We talked about some of the aspects of the Sass file naming convention in the "File
            Structure" section.</p>

        <p>Each file is lowerCamelCase named and prefixed by an underscore(_) so that it is considered
            by the Sass compiler
            as a partial and
            not rendered to a standalone CSS file. The only exception to this rule is the components'
            standalone
            versions (see the "Components" section for details about this).
        </p>

        <p>
            Each folder has a single entry point in charge of importing other partial Sass files. This
            file is
            named after the folder's name, and is prefixed with two underscores(__) so that it always
            appears on top
            in the files list. It imports only the files in its own folder, except for other summary
            index located in
            a direct subfolder. This way, you always can handle your imports very easily and stop the
            imports
            of nested files at any level.<br>
            Components definition files should have the same name as the component's folder name, and
            have a
            single underscore prefix.
        </p>

        <h2>Sass contents</h2>

        <p>For placeholders, used in the _helpers files or the components definitions, we recommend a
            mix of lowerCamelCase,
            dashes(-) and underscores(_). Helpers and components prefix should stick to lowerCamelCase,
            while components
            placeholders should include the component's prefix and separate sub parts from it with a
            dash or underscore.
            Sass treats dashes and underscores as if they were the same character, so they are totally
            invertible.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            Note that those are only guidelines, and if for any reason you prefer to go with another
            convention
            in your project, you're free to do so. HTML classes and file names conventions have a
            rationale behind
            them which offers you some advantages, but for the sass files contents it's really just a
            matter of
            preference. We offer a suggestion only to provide some common ground for DoCSSa users.
        </p>

        <div class="exampleNote">
            <p>For example, you could pass ".myExampleClass" as a selector to a component mixin for an
                implementation that
                would look like this :
            </p>
            <samp class="sampleTitle">// example</samp>
<pre class="codeSample">
#{$selector} {
@extend %componentName;
}
#{$selector}__singleItem {
@extend %componentName__singleItem
&amp;:hover {
@extend %componentName__singleItem-altState
}
}
</pre>
        </div>
        <h2>SASS variables</h2>

        <p>Sass variable names should be composed of dash(-) separated parts, with each part sorted from
            the most
            generic to the most specific variable characteristic. This is quite useful in most IDE as
            you can take
            advantage of autocompletion.
