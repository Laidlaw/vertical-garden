        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">What is DoCSSa ?</h2>

        <p>DoCSSa is a CSS architecture and methodology that tries to combine all the good parts of the current state of
            the art.<br>
            It is intended for use in large, long lived sites, on which many frontend developers may be working
            over time.<br>
            The name stands for <em>Deferred Object CSS Architecture</em>.</p>

        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">What are the benefits of doing things the DoCSSa way?</h2>

        <ul class="firstOrderList">
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                        <span class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                            DoCSSa lets you define snippets of style you can reuse everywhere, without repeating yourself,
                            while keeping the flexibility you need and correct semantics.
                        </span>
            </li>
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                        <span class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                            DoCSSa is scalable and maintainable. It is based on Sass, and suggests a file structure that
                            allows for small, modular components. As most thing have a dedicated place, the developers can
                            easily find the part they have to work on, update it, remove obsolete rules, etc.
                        </span>
            </li>
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                        <span class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                            DoCSSa keeps your CSS from leaking to unwanted places by using a naming convention for classnames,
                            which reflects the modularity of the reusable blocks at work and their constitutive elements.
                        </span>
            </li>
            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                        <span class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                            DoCSSa is easy to setup and as flexible as you want it to be. It's only a starting point. Where
                            you go from it is up to you and your team!
                        </span>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">Why does DoCSSa exist ?</h2>

        <p>As frontend web developers, we are living in a world of evergrowing complexity. What once was a
            relatively easy thing to do (putting aside browsers inconsistencies) has grown into a very complex,
            dynamic, everchanging reality.</p>

        <p>We can't put up to the pace, and honestly do we really want to? Wouldn't we be better off by planning
            ahead what can be planned and setting up a flexible structure in order to be more efficient and less
            under pressure when the rough times come ? The way we see it, the more work we
            can avoid by having defined the right tools and the right architecture ahead of time, the better.</p>

        <p>DoCSSa is our attempt at an organization that aims toward a faster workflow without sacrificing the
            long run flexibility.</p>

        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">How does DoCSSa bring its benefits ?</h2>

        <p>DoCSSa is based on Sass, and leverages some of its key features to achieve its goal.
            Most notably, DoCSSa takes advantage of placeholders, mixins, and imports.
            It also suggests a file system organisation and a BEM based naming convention, and integrates
            the core ideas found in OOCSS, SmaCSS and DRY CSS.</p>
