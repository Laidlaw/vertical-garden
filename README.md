##History

We're pulling alot from [Ben Smithett](https://github.com/bensmithett/style) but starting with [docssa](http://docssa.info/) as the logic for the sass structure.

Forrest has a pretty interesting technique with fittext that we will document soon.

Waypoints is a questionable choice because it relies on jquery but it seems all sites these days use scroll/viewport detection. It may be useful in the future to make this a yeoman generator with opinionated options for susy, waypoints and fittext.
